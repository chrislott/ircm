# ![http://ircm.googlecode.com/files/icon.png](http://ircm.googlecode.com/files/icon.png) iRCm : IRC on your iPhone #

This is a GUI-based Internet Relay Chat client for the Apple iPhone, by Chris Lott (aka pogi) and Nicholas Penree (aka drudge).

## Notes: ##

I believe this is finally "usable" in a sense. you can join channels with /join and you can do raw irc commands with /raw for those that know what they're doing.

## Special Thanks: ##

Thank you to everyone in #iphone-uikit for their help in getting me started in the right direction.  Especially Arminius working together to get our "chat" apps running (see his AIM app at http://apolloim.googlecode.com) and also Drudge and LG for their help.  Drudge also maintains a repository ([Conceited Software](http://conceitedsoftware.com/iphone)) so if you're using installer.app from http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/ you can get iRCm from there.

Extra special thanks to wiredless for the new icon!

## Updates: ##
**3/11/08**: I will most likely port this over to iPhone 2.0.  Although Colloq is neat it has too much bloat that I don't think is needed on the iPhone.  We'll see....


**8/27**:

Finally a release! Here's the latest screenshots.  Arminius and I are proud to show off our "usable" binaries. You can get the binary right here by going to Downloads or getting it from PXL or Installer.app (if its not there, it will be soon).  You can get Arminius' Apollo IM at http://apolloim.googlecode.com/ and click on Downloads.
